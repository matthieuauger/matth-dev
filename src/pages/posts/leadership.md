excerpt: How can we define leadership nowadays?

---
Leadership is quite a difficult notion to apprehend.

When you ask people what a leader is, some will tell you "_It's when, at lunch time, you look for a place to eat and someone guide the group to a food destination_". In my company, there is an official definition: leadership is defined as "_The ability to bring long-lasting change_".

Jesus was a leader. He brought massive change in the world with billions of preachers, and many years after he died, christianity still exists.

Steve Jobs was a leader. He brought ground-breaking innovation in the music and mobile landscape with his iPod and iPhone. Years after, we still use Apple products and there is a huge fanbase for the brand.

Yet the basic definition of "_The ability to bring long-lasting change_" is incomplete to me.

Let's take an example: In 1997, in a surprising allocution, french president Jacques Chirac decided to dismantle the parlement. This single decision brought a massive change in french government because new deputies needed to be elected.

In this specific situation, was Jacques Chirac a leader? I think not. There was a system in place, the law, that gave french president _power_ to do so, and every human being can bring change when he is in a situation of _power_.

So what is different separates Jesus, Steve Jobs from Jacques Chirac? The changes they brought to these people have been brought without a single ounce of power. And when there is no power, you actually have to _convince_ people.

The last definition I refer to when talking about leadership is "_The ability to move people, and change their behaviours durably_".

What is important there?

* _Change their behaviours_: in fine, everything in the world is the result of our actions, of our behaviours. As leaders, this is where we need to work on
* _Move people_: which actually implies you have to convince them. You cannot be a leader if you don't talk, if you don't sell

Once you accept this definition you can work on how to convince people, and remark that all of our so-called leaders today are greats convincers.

When they talk, they start with [why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA), they create beautiful stories, they show you what will change in your life when you adopt the behaviours they want you to adopt.
