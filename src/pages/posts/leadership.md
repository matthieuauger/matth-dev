excerpt: How can we define leadership nowadays?

---
Leadership is quite a difficult notion to apprehend.

When you ask people what a leader is, some will tell you "_It's when, at lunch time, you look for a place to eat and someone guide the group to a destination_". In my company, there is another definition: leadership is defined as "_The ability to bring long-lasting change_".

Jesus was a leader. He brought massive change in the world with billions of followers, and many years after he died, christianity still exists. 

Steve Jobs was a leader. He brought ground-breaking innovation in the music and mobile landscape with his iPod and iPhone. Years after, this change is still there in our societies.

Yet the basic definition of "_The ability to bring long-lasting change_" is incomplete.
